One of the most important elements, Dr. Karageorghis found, is a
song's tempo, which should be between 120 and 140 beats-per-minute, or
B.P.M.  That pace coincides with the range of most commercial dance
music, and many rock songs are near that range, which leads people to
develop "an aesthetic appreciation for that tempo," he said. It also
roughly corresponds to the average person's heart rate during a
routine workout - say, 20 minutes on an elliptical trainer by a person
who is more casual exerciser than fitness warrior.
